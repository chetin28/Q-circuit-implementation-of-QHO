# Q-circuit implementation of QHO  
 
Consider simple Quantum Harmonic Oscillator  $H_{QHO} = \hbar \omega (\hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + 1/2) $  
a) Implement this Hamiltonian. Parametrize as you wish, but make sure you have N>20 and a
meaningful frequency), Qutip is highly recommended for visualization later, but Qiskit also has
an implementation for this, if you prefer to use it instead.  
b) Plot the expectation value of $\hat{n}$, $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p }$ for a coherent state as a function of time with an envelope
that describes the operators variance.  
c) Make a movie of Wigner quasiprobability distribution and Fock distribution as a function of
time  
d) Do the same with a squeezed coherent state.
